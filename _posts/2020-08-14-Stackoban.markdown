[Stackoban](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=35f8154bdb26a1fe9599a7c76e88caf9) is the first puzzle game I've designed in [Puzzlescript](https://www.puzzlescript.net/), an open-source web-based engine. The game is an entry into the block-pushing puzzle genre stemming from 1981's Sokoban, the twist in this case being that not only can you push boxes, but you can stack them as well. Stacks are unstable, however, so a push is likely to send them toppling down in a line.
